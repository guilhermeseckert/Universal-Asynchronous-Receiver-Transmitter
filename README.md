UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)
is a type of serial communication protocol, where it is widely
used and plays an important role in the automation of
equipment and devices that use this technology. Serial
communication is used to exchange information between
devices at low cost and low transmission speed over a short
distance between devices. In order to demonstrate the true
functioning of the serial communication, a VHDL language
system was developed for wireless by infrared data transmission
between two FPGA devices, the Baud Rate being transmitted and
the verification was verified if the data was transmitted
successfully through the Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error
detection. To do so, we designed the logic system of the
equipment using block diagram, state machine and simulation of
the system in Quartus and FPGA's. Thus, it was possible to obtain
the expected results successfully, concluding that serial
communication has significant use today.
